# Autolight

The Autolight Health Monitoring System is a project aimed at integrating health indicators with ambient lighting.
This application utilizes a combination of health monitoring devices and connected lamps to adjust lighting levels based
on an individual's health status. The core concept revolves around using real-time health data to dynamically regulate
the lighting environment, promoting wellness and comfort.

Technicians can add Devices to Users and each Device can read some data about Usersâ€™ health,
Users can look at warnings about their health and change Lamps characteristics based on this.
